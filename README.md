1) Give an overview of what the project is

For this project we decided to implement the classic game of Pong on a Nexys-3 FPGA and a VGA Display Monitor

Brief Game Overview
- There are two paddles on the right-most and left-most sides of the screen
- A ball bounces between the paddles and off the top and bottom walls
- A player wins when their opponent fails to use their paddle to bounce the ball back
